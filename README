AUTHOR // Byron L Lagrone

DEPENDENCIES //
Requires Crypto.Cipher (not included) and __getch.py (included)


USAGE // 
You can also get usage information by passing -help or no arguments to byc at the command prompt.

byc -e [filename] 		:: requests a password, then writes the encrypted file [filename].byc
byc -d [filename]		:: requests a password, then writes the decrypted file [filename].decrypted


EXAMPLE //
Asserting we have the file "example.txt" containing the text "Hello Encryption!", and a Linux command prompt:
We wish to encrypt the file, and email it to a friend.
In the Linux command prompt:

>./byc -e example.txt

The program prompts us to enter a password.
After entering the password, a new file is created -- "example.txt.byc" in this case -- containing the encrypted text.
We would first delete the un-encrypted file on the origin machine if necessary, then e-mail the .byc file to another computer containing backyardcrypt.

In the Linux command prompt on the receiving end, once we have copied "example.txt.byc" to the same directory as backyardcrypt:

>./byc -d example.txt

The program will prompt us to enter the password.
A file, "example.txt.decrypted", is immediately created. If the password was entered correctly, the file will contain the decrypted text plus a reminder to delete the file once finished. If the password was not entered correctly, the file will contain gibberish plus the reminder to delete the file once finished.
